# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis:

PyBer is a ride-sharing app company that uses Python-based programming and wishes to improve access to ridesharing services for its customers. Additionally, it is of interests to them to determine the affordability for underserved neighborhoods using data that highlights the timeframe from January 2019 to April 2019. Our mission is to create a report that summarizes how the data differs by city type and how those differences can be used by decision-makers at PyBer.


## Results:
### *Description of the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.*

**Summary of PyBer's ride-sharing data:**

From our finding above, the average fare per ride in urban areas ($24.53) is greater than the average fare per driver ($16.57). The reverse findings are true in the other areas, where average fare per driver ($55.49 in rural towns and $39.50 in suburbs) exceeds average fare per ride ($34.62 in rural towns and $30.97 in suburbs). 

**Multiple-line chart:**

The graph above shows that rural fares have the lowest fares, peaking in the month of April, but overall was not profitable for PyBer. Suburban fare faired average, performing better than in rural areas but still was not profitable for PyBer. Only in urban areas do we see a consistent increase in fare and was profitable for PyBer. 

## Summary:
### *Three business recommendations to the PyBer CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types:*

**1. Increase drivers in suburban and rural ares**

In the early months of 2019, urban areas employed 80.9% of total drivers, while suburbs made up 16.5% of total drivers and rural towns had 2.6% of total drivers. Since the data shows that there are good paying customers in suburban and rural areas then we can predict that there are great opportunities to expand the PyBer business outside of the urban scope. To test our predictions, I would recommend hiring more drivers to operate in rural and suburban areas.

**2. Continue to increase ride shares in urban cities**

It is evident that urban cities fares are the highest and consistent, and so it would be the best option for profitable returns and a safe recommendation to continue increasing opportunities and rides. Recommending adding more drivers in suburban and rural areas still makes good sense, but it is important to consider that there may be diminishing returns. Therefore, I would recommend increasing the productivity of drivers in urban areas since they are already yielding good businessand could potentially offset any loses when employing more drivers in suburban and rural areas. One way to incentivize drivers in urban areas to be more productive is offering perks and benefits for picking up or dropping off riders in the suburban and rural areas and make longer trips outside of urban boundaries.

**3. Increase fare per ride to expand the business** 

Currently, rural cities have the lowest fares of the other two city types. And from the multiple line chart above, we can see that total fares by city type never intersect. Therefore, I recommend increase fare per ride and this would increase the business's financial growth significantly. Also seeing the summary of boxplots below, the medium fare costs are pretty evenly distributed. This is a safe recommendations to start growing the business in multiple facades.
